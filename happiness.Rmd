```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
data16 <- read.csv(file = '2016.csv')
data17 <- read.csv(file = '2017.csv')
data18 <- read.csv(file = '2018.csv')
data19 <- read.csv(file = '2019.csv')
```


## World Happiness Report analysis

See info and data source 
<https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness>

```{r}
summary(data16)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(data16$Happiness.Score, data16$Health..Life.Expectancy.)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
